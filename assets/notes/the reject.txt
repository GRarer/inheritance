Character:The Reject
Project S1 Experiment Log
January 14, 195{X} - In my career as a scientist, nothing has excited me more than the discovery of the "double helix." That the infinite complexity of life could be encoded in such a simple form sends shivers up my spine. While it is tempting to take this as an opportunity to philosophize about life's beauty, that has never been my strong suit. Instead I will focus on my specialty. My hypothesis is that simple code can be simply replicated. My goal is to duplicate existing species, creating parentless individuals as a stepping stone to fathering a new species.
February 8, 195{X} - My experiments with duplication of life are progressing encouragingly enough. I have managed to grow lilies, pitcher plants, and Venus flytraps from artificially synthesized seeds. I believe I will be able to replicate mammals soon enough.
March 20, 195{X} - The lillies are growing quite nicely. The difficulty in ethically sourcing animals to experiment upon provides an intolerable delay in the next stage of my plans. Progressing to human cloning is an exercise in hubris, but my grasp of the theory is so strong I doubt there is much chance of any adverse results.
March 21, 195{X} - My clone. He melted.
